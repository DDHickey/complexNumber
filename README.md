# complexNumber
A C++ program that calculates the polar, complex and rectangular coordinates for a given coordinate value.

The program was created as practice for a state C++ competition in which competitors demonstrate C++ abilities and coding logic.
Therefore, I incorrporated reading from an external file as practice and different strategies only to further practice my logic for C++.
